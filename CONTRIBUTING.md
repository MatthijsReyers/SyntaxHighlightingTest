## Guidelines: adding a language

### Should I?
We request that you do not add languages to the repository if the language was made by you or if it is a code golf language that does not see widespread use.
Any languages that see commercial or academic use are of course allowed.

### File layout
The first two lines of the document should be single line comments with a link to this repository and a list people who have contributed to the file.
Specifically try to adhere to the following format: `Contributors: [name], [name], [name]`. If preffered using a nickname is allowed too.
If the language does not have (single line) comments please use the standard way of commenting for the specific language or feel free to be creative if comments do not exist.

## Guidelines: modifing a file
If you would like to you take credit for your addition, you may do so by adding yourself to the contributors list at the top of the file (Please make sure to do that in the same pull request).

## Guidelines: code
Showing off all the features of the language is more important than creating a proper program that actually does something.
All code should be syntaticaly correct and compile/run without error.

Needless to say, any attempt execute external or obfuscated code will not be accepted. 
If it all possible without missing features, please avoid the use of network connections and system calls. 
All code in the repository should be safe to compile/run (altough we do not recommend doing this).
